## üéØ SPECIALIZED MODES (KISS Design)

### 1. Code Mode (Default - Simple Coding)
**Purpose:** General-purpose coding tasks
**KISS Approach:** Minimal context, direct actions

```bash
# Usage: Focus on immediate coding needs
code "add error handling to login function"
code "create user profile component"
code "fix the database connection issue"
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Direct file operations (read, edit, create)
- ‚úÖ Simple command execution
- ‚úÖ Basic search and replace
- ‚ùå No complex planning or orchestration

### 2. Architect Mode (Planning & Design)
**Purpose:** Technical planning and system design
**KISS Approach:** Clear deliverables, actionable plans

```bash
# Usage: Generate simple, actionable plans
architect "design user authentication system"
architect "plan database schema for e-commerce"
architect "create API structure for mobile app"
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Generate simple project structures
- ‚úÖ Create clear implementation plans
- ‚úÖ Define basic system architectures
- ‚ùå No complex diagrams or documentation

### 3. Ask Mode (Information & Analysis)
**Purpose:** Answer questions about codebase
**KISS Approach:** Direct answers, no verbosity

```bash
# Usage: Quick codebase understanding
ask "how does user authentication work?"
ask "where is the payment processing logic?"
ask "what are the main data models?"
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Search codebase for patterns
- ‚úÖ Explain code functionality simply
- ‚úÖ Find related files and functions
- ‚ùå No lengthy explanations or tutorials

### 4. Debug Mode (Problem Diagnosis)
**Purpose:** Systematic problem identification
**KISS Approach:** Step-by-step diagnosis, clear fixes

```bash
# Usage: Focused debugging workflow
debug "app crashes on login"
debug "database connection fails"
debug "API returns 500 error"
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Run basic diagnostic checks
- ‚úÖ Test common failure scenarios
- ‚úÖ Provide specific fix suggestions
- ‚ùå No complex debugging tools or profilers

---

## üéº ORCHESTRATOR MODE (Complex Projects)

**Purpose:** Coordinate multi-step development tasks
**KISS Approach:** Simple workflow, clear checkpoints

```bash
# Usage: Break down complex tasks
orchestrate "build e-commerce checkout system"
orchestrate "implement user registration flow"
orchestrate "migrate legacy authentication"
```

**KISS Workflow:**
1. **Analyze** - Quick codebase understanding
2. **Plan** - 3-5 simple steps maximum
3. **Execute** - Step-by-step implementation
4. **Verify** - Basic functionality checks

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Each step completes in < 30 minutes
- ‚úÖ Clear success/failure indicators
- ‚úÖ Easy rollback if needed
- ‚ùå No complex project management overhead

---

## üìù CONTEXT MENTIONS (Codebase Understanding)

**Purpose:** Help AI understand codebase context
**KISS Approach:** Simple file references, no complex parsing

### Basic Context Mentioning
```javascript
// In any request, simply mention files
"update the user model in src/models/user.js"
"fix the login bug in src/auth/login.js"
"add validation to src/forms/contact.js"
```

### Smart Context Detection
**Auto-detect relevant files based on:**
- Current working directory
- Recently modified files
- Import relationships
- Function dependencies

### Context Shortcuts
```bash
# Quick context for common patterns
@user-model    ‚Üí src/models/user.js
@auth-system   ‚Üí src/auth/
@login-page    ‚Üí src/pages/login.js
@api-routes    ‚Üí src/routes/api.js
```

---

## üîß SMART TOOLS (File Operations & Commands)

**Philosophy:** Powerful but simple, zero-configuration

### 1. File Operations (Enhanced)
```bash
# Smart file creation with templates
create component Button
create model User
create test login

# Smart file editing with context
edit src/user.js "add validation method"
edit src/auth.js "fix password hash"

# Smart file analysis
analyze src/user.js
dependencies src/auth.js
```

### 2. Command Execution (Safe & Smart)
```bash
# Auto-detect project type and run appropriate commands
run tests        # npm test, pytest, etc.
run build        # npm run build, webpack, etc.
run lint         # eslint, pylint, etc.
run start        # npm start, python app.py, etc.

# Safe command execution with confirmation
run "rm -rf node_modules"  # Would require explicit confirmation
```

### 3. Code Search & Navigation
```bash
# Simple but powerful search
find "user authentication"
find function "validateEmail"
find class "UserModel"

# Context-aware navigation
goto login component
goto user model
goto api routes
```

## üîÑ KISS PRINCIPLES APPLIED

### 1. **15-Minute Rule**
Every feature must provide value within 15 minutes of use.

### 2. **Zero-Maintenance**
Tools work without configuration or ongoing maintenance.

### 3. **Fail-Fast with Guidance**
When something goes wrong, provide clear, actionable guidance.

### 4. **Progressive Enhancement**
Start simple, enhance based on actual usage patterns.

### 5. **Human-Friendly Automation**
Automation helps humans make better decisions, not replace judgment.

debug "login button not working"
```

### Context-Aware Work
```bash
# Mention files for context
