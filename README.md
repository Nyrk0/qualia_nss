# Qualia-NSS: Near-field Speaker Simulator

This project is a web-based audio analysis tool designed to simulate and visualize near-field speaker behavior. It provides a suite of modules for in-depth audio analysis, including spectrograms, spectrum analyzers, and psychoacoustic modeling.

## Features

*   **7-Band Psychoacoustic Analysis**: Visualize audio across 7 critical psychoacoustic bands.
*   **Spectrogram Visualization**: Analyze the frequency content of audio signals over time.
*   **Comb Filtering Detection**: Identify and analyze comb filtering artifacts.
*   **SPL Curve Analysis**: Upload and analyze Sound Pressure Level (SPL) data from various sources.

## Modules

The project is composed of several standalone and integrated modules:

*   `7band-level-meter`
*   `comb-filtering`
*   `spectrogram`
*   `spectrum-analyzer`

## Getting Started
