# UI/UX Wireframe

This document outlines the proposed user interface and user experience for the Qualia-NSS application.

## 1. Overall Layout

*   **Main View**: A central area for the primary visualization (e.g., Spectrogram or SPL Graph).
*   **Control Panel**: A sidebar or top bar containing controls for audio playback, module selection, and parameter adjustments.
*   **File/Data Input**: A dedicated section for uploading or selecting audio files and SPL data.
*   **Module Selector**: A clear way for users to switch between different analysis modules.

## 2. User Flow

1.  **Landing Page**: User is presented with a default view, perhaps the 7-band level meter with a sample audio source.
2.  **Data Input**: User uploads a `.csv` or `.txt` file with SPL data, or selects a live audio input.
3.  **Visualization**: The main view updates with the selected analysis module, rendering the data.
4.  **Interaction**: User can adjust parameters, zoom/pan the visualization, and switch between different modules to analyze the same data source from multiple perspectives.

## 3. Mockups (Placeholder)

*(This section will contain sketches, diagrams, or links to digital mockups to illustrate the proposed UI.)*
