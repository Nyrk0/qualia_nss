# 00 - Introduction to the Qualia-NSS Workflow

Welcome to the user guide for the Qualia-NSS project. This guide will walk you through the process of designing and analyzing a high-quality loudspeaker setup.

The process follows the logical order of the tools presented in the main application navbar:

1.  **Speakers:** Analyze the raw performance of your individual speaker drivers.
2.  **Filters:** Design crossovers and equalization to shape the sound.
3.  **Cabinets:** Model the physical enclosure for your speakers.
4.  **7-Band Meter:** Perform real-time psychoacoustic analysis.
5.  **Spectrogram:** Conduct advanced, full-spectrum analysis.

Let's begin with the first step: analyzing your speakers.
