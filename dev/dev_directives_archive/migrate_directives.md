## üîÑ Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Create Core Consolidated Files

#### Step 1.1: Create MASTER_WORKFLOW.md
```bash
# Consolidate these files:
cat dev/dev_directives/workflow-pipeline.md > dev/core/MASTER_WORKFLOW.md
echo "\n---\n## Staged Development (Absorbed)" >> dev/core/MASTER_WORKFLOW.md  
cat dev/dev_directives/staged_development_methodology.md >> dev/core/MASTER_WORKFLOW.md
echo "\n---\n## AI Task Management (Absorbed)" >> dev/core/MASTER_WORKFLOW.md
cat dev/dev_directives/ai_task_workflow.md >> dev/core/MASTER_WORKFLOW.md
```

#### Step 1.2: Create UI_UX_STANDARDS.md  
```bash
# Consolidate these files:
cat dev/dev_directives/ui-ux-directive.md > dev/core/UI_UX_STANDARDS.md
echo "\n---\n## Web Components Standards (Absorbed)" >> dev/core/UI_UX_STANDARDS.md
cat dev/dev_directives/web_components_curation.md >> dev/core/UI_UX_STANDARDS.md
```

#### Step 1.3: Create ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md
```bash
# Consolidate these files:  
cat dev/dev_directives/modular_architecture_guide.md > dev/core/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md
echo "\n---\n## Documentation Pipeline (Absorbed)" >> dev/core/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md
cat dev/dev_directives/documentation_pipeline.md >> dev/core/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md
```

### Phase 2: Move Specialized Rules
```bash
# Create specialized directory
mkdir -p dev/specialized/

# Move domain-specific files (keep as-is)
mv dev/dev_directives/colormap_architecture.md dev/specialized/
mv dev/dev_directives/hybrid-development-workflow.md dev/specialized/  
mv dev/dev_directives/safe_development_workflows.md dev/specialized/
mv dev/dev_directives/claude_code_restrictions.md dev/specialized/
```

### Phase 3: Archive Old Files
```bash  
# Create archive directory
mkdir -p dev/dev_directives_archive/

# Move absorbed files to archive
mv dev/dev_directives/workflow-pipeline.md dev/dev_directives_archive/
mv dev/dev_directives/staged_development_methodology.md dev/dev_directives_archive/
mv dev/dev_directives/ai_task_workflow.md dev/dev_directives_archive/
mv dev/dev_directives/ui-ux-directive.md dev/dev_directives_archive/
mv dev/dev_directives/web_components_curation.md dev/dev_directives_archive/  
mv dev/dev_directives/modular_architecture_guide.md dev/dev_directives_archive/
mv dev/dev_directives/documentation_pipeline.md dev/dev_directives_archive/

# Remove empty dev_directives directory
rmdir dev/dev_directives/
```

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### After Migration - Verify These Work
- [ ] **AGENTS.md** - AI assistants can understand project structure
- [ ] **DEV_RULES_INDEX.md** - Easy navigation to all rules
- [ ] **dev/core/MASTER_WORKFLOW.md** - Complete development process
- [ ] **dev/core/UI_UX_STANDARDS.md** - All UI/UX and component rules  
- [ ] **dev/core/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md** - System architecture and documentation
- [ ] **dev/specialized/** - Domain-specific rules preserved

### Update References
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md ‚Üí Point to AGENTS.md  
- [ ] Update GEMINI.md ‚Üí Point to AGENTS.md
- [ ] Update any documentation links to old dev_directives/
- [ ] Update workflow references in other files
- [ ] Test AI assistant understanding with new structure

---

## üéØ Benefits After Migration

### For AI Assistants
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth (AGENTS.md) - no confusion between Claude/Gemini instructions
- ‚úÖ Clear rule hierarchy - know which file to reference for what purpose  
- ‚úÖ Reduced context switching - consolidated related rules together
- ‚úÖ Easy navigation - master index with clear usage guide

### For Human Developers  
- ‚úÖ 36% reduction in files to maintain (11 ‚Üí 7 files)
- ‚úÖ Clear separation: core rules vs specialized rules  
- ‚úÖ Master index for quick rule lookup
- ‚úÖ Consolidated related concepts - no rule hunting

### For Project Maintenance
- ‚úÖ Easier rule consistency - fewer files to sync
- ‚úÖ Clearer ownership - core vs specialized rule domains
- ‚úÖ Better version control - fewer merge conflicts
- ‚úÖ Future-ready - scalable structure for new rules

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Migration Warnings

### Do NOT Execute Until
- [ ] Review AGENTS.md for completeness vs CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md
- [ ] Validate DEV_RULES_INDEX.md covers all use cases
- [ ] Confirm no critical rules would be lost in consolidation
- [ ] Test AI assistant understanding with sample questions

### Backup Strategy  
```bash
# Create full backup before migration
cp -r dev/ dev_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)/
git add . && git commit -m "backup: dev_directives before consolidation"
```

### Rollback Plan
```bash
# If migration fails, restore from backup
rm -rf dev/
mv dev_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)/ dev/
git add . && git commit -m "rollback: restore original dev_directives"
```

**Execute this migration when ready to simplify your development rules structure. The new system will be much easier for both AI assistants and human developers to navigate and maintain.**
