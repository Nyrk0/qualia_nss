Hello Claude. I need your expertise in auditing a code change in a WebGL-based 3D spectrogram module.

The goal of this change was to take two aesthetic visual effects that were negatively impacting the module's analytical accuracy and make them optional via UI toggles.

Your task is to perform a code review comparing the original version of the files with my new, modified version. Please verify if my changes correctly implement the intended features and if they adhere to the project's coding standards.

**Feature Description:**

The two effects to be made optional are:
1.  **Temporal Fade-out ("Fade"):** A visual effect where the spectrogram history fades to black over time.
2.  **Brightness Threshold ("Bright"):** A visual noise gate that renders any signal below 10% intensity as pure black.

I have added two toggles to the UI and introduced `u_enableFade` and `u_enableGate` uniforms into the WebGL fragment shader to control these effects.

**Files for Audit:**

*   **Original Files:**
    *   `src/js/sidebar-manager.js.bckp`
    *   `src/spectrogram/spectrogram.js.bckp`
    *   `src/spectrogram/styles.css.bckp`
*   **New Modified Files:**
    *   `src/js/sidebar-manager.js`
    *   `src/spectrogram/spectrogram.js`
    *   `src/spectrogram/styles.css`

**Audit Checklist & Questions:**

1.  **UI Changes:** In `sidebar-manager.js`, did I correctly add the new UI toggles for "Fade" and "Bright"? Are they positioned at the top of the sidebar, before the main accordion, as requested?
2.  **Styling:** In `styles.css`, is the new `.analysis-mode-controls` class implemented correctly to style the new container?
3.  **Shader Logic:** In `spectrogram.js`, review the `sonogramFragmentShader`. Does it correctly use the `u_enableFade` and `u_enableGate` uniforms to conditionally apply the effects? When the uniforms are false, does the logic correctly fall back to rendering the raw, unaltered data?
4.  **JavaScript Logic:** Still in `spectrogram.js`:
    *   Does the `AnalyserView` class correctly initialize the new `fadeEnabled` and `gateEnabled` properties?
    *   Are the uniform locations (`u_enableFadeLoc`, `u_enableGateLoc`) correctly retrieved?
    *   Are the uniforms correctly updated with the property values in the `drawGL` render loop?
    *   Are the public methods `setFadeEnabled()` and `setGateEnabled()` implemented correctly?
    *   Does the `initializeSpectrogram` function correctly find the new toggle elements and attach event listeners that call the appropriate methods?
5.  **Overall Assessment:** Are there any introduced bugs, performance regressions, or violations of the project's ES6+ coding standards that I may have missed?

Please provide a summary of your findings based on this checklist.

Thank you for your collaboration.
