## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the Natural Surround Sound (NSS) concept as an alternative approach to immersive audio that intentionally leverages acoustic delay, speaker's overlap frequency response, harmonics, haas (precedence) effect, bark (24 critical bands) along with 7-band psychoacoustic simplicity, human audible frequency response with standard phon sensitivity curves —ISO standard SPL curves— analysis patterns and comb-filtering simulation for anticipatory control and avoidance. 

The resulting two-set stereo speaker system —4.0, expandable to 4.1 for improved sub-bass response on bookshelf quadraphonic QUALIA•NSS loudspeakers design— represents a creative free paradigm shift from traditional audio engineering, transforming delay into a natural tool with no budgetary constraints and DIY friendly for immersive audio listening experience enhancement with psychoacoustic simplicity.

## Core NSS Architecture Analysis

### Two-Set Speaker System Design

The fundamental innovation lies in the deliberate use of two complementary stereo speaker sets:

**Set A: Primary Stereo Speakers**
- DIY but also traditional 2-way design allowed(studio monitors, bookshelves, or mains)
- Fs can be around 100Hz for bookshelves or 60Hz for mains.
- Handles from mid-bass to treble frequencies (60Hz - 20kHz)
- Provides primary stereo imaging
— Required superior brilliance quality for treble frequencies, as user taste.
— 1st order tweeter filter protection is mandatory. 2nd order is optional but not recommended. 3rd and 4rd order crossovers are not allowed as an option in QUALIA•NSS design.
— Required good quality full-range drivers with low distortion on treble frequencies due to cone compression.
— 1st order high-pass filter to prevent low-frequency sounds from reaching the speaker may be required for full-range drivers, if high SPL usage is expected.
- Transient response must be fast for audio quality.

**Set B: Bass/Mid-Bass Enhancement**
- Specialized 1-way design (preferred driver response range from 50Hz to 2kHz)
- Fs around 50Hz
- 1st order low-pass filter (LPF) to prevent high-frequency sounds near 2kHz and above, could be mandatory for Haas effect optimization and comb-filtering control. 
- Focuses on critical mid-bass presence
- Creates acoustic layering through placement
— Must meet QUALIA•NSS companion criteria in relation to Set A.
- Transient response must be fast for audio quality.
— DIY loudspeaker Set B is almost mandatory to meet the above design requirements.

### Intentional Delay Engineering

The placement-derived audio delays are the cornerstone of NSS psychoacoustics:

**Delay Creation Mechanisms:**
1. **Geometric Placement**: Different distances from listener to each speaker set
2. **Acoustic Path Differences**: Room reflections and diffraction effects
3. **Frequency-Specific Propagation**: Different wavelengths create varying delay patterns

**Psychoacoustic Benefits:**
- Natural reverberation enhancement
- Spatial depth perception
- Immersive field expansion
- Harmonic reinforcement through interference

## Delay as Creative Tool

### Traditional vs. NSS Approach

**Traditional Audio Engineering:**
- Goal: flat-response design caveat.
- DSP generally used for correction.
— Complex crossover networks are mandatory for flat-response design with no frequency overlap between drivers.
— Transients loss: all the sounds lacks his unique distintive character.
- 2D soundfield, no depth perception.
— "mathematically" and "mentally" perceived sound quality perfection derivate from "flat-response" design.
— 1D soundfield on compact stereo systems with no loudspeakers separation.

**NSS Psychoacoustic Design:**
- Goal: optimize frequency overlap drivers design and loudspeaker placement for desired 3D soundfieldpsychoacoustic immersive listening experience.
- No DSP required
- Timing differences create immersion
— 1rst order filters
— Transients preservation: all the sounds retains his unique distintive character.
— Most DIY budget available for good quality drivers instead of complex crossovers networks and/or DSP equipment.
— NSS properties invite further exploration, custom DIY loudspeaker design and research.

### Frequency Domain Analysis

The harmonic resonance approach creates constructive sound field reinforcement:

**Fundamental Series Example:**
- Subwoofer: Fs = 25Hz
- Set B: Fs = 50Hz (2nd harmonic)
- Set A: Fs = 100Hz (4th harmonic)

This creates natural reinforcement, enhancing the psychoacoustic foundation as research shows just where human listening lacks sensitivity at low SPL. Our ears are'n flat frequency devices. 

The NSS loudpskeaper design provides all the sub-bass, mid-bass and low-mids frequencies in detail enriching the soundfield, avoiding typical masking issues when just stereo loudspeakers providing 2D soundfield are used. Transients are preserved and all the sounds retains his unique distintive character from your selected main Set A loudspeaker, providing precense and brilliance in front of you, plus a new immersive spatialization around you as you choose to place the Set B loudspeaker companion. 

NSS is friendly with all standard stereo sound sources (vinyl, cd, streaming apps, etc.)
Come on and listen to the difference.

## NSS is not designed for: 
— NSS is not for live sound events, which requires high SPL frequency-band specific drivers, with complex crossover networks and DSP.
— NSS is not for audio production, wich requires flat response drivers and DSP.
- NSS is not for flat-response lovers.
