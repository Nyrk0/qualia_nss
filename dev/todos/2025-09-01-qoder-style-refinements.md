## 5. Quality Assurance Checklist

### Pre-Implementation
- [x] Backup files created for all modified files
- [x] Development directives reviewed and understood
- [x] Reference implementation (styles-qoder.css) analyzed

### During Implementation
- [ ] Each stage tested independently before proceeding
- [ ] CSS follows modular architecture guidelines
- [ ] No hardcoded values used (CSS variables only)
- [ ] Semantic HTML hierarchy maintained

### Post-Implementation Testing
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Sidebar radio button alignment implementation complete
- [x] Navigation functionality preserved
- [x] All CSS variables properly defined and used
- [x] No syntax errors in any modified files
- [ ] User verification of sidebar radio button alignment
- [ ] Theme toggle working properly
- [ ] Responsive design tested (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified

---

## 6. Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies
- Existing modular CSS architecture must be preserved
- Bootstrap 5.3.0 compatibility maintained
- JavaScript functionality unaffected
- All existing modules continue to work

### Risk Mitigation
- Backup files created for all modified files
- Staged implementation allows rollback at any point
- CSS specificity carefully managed to avoid conflicts
- Testing at each stage ensures stability

### Rollback Plan
If any stage fails:
1. Immediately restore from backup files (.bckup extensions)
2. Identify specific issue causing failure
3. Adjust implementation approach
4. Re-test before proceeding
