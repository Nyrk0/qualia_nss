**Feature Request: Automated Integration Between Windsurf Cascade and Gemini CLI**

I want to enhance Windsurf Cascade's context management by automatically integrating it with Gemini CLI's semantic analysis and large context windows.

**Goal:** Create automated bridge where Gemini CLI handles project-wide context analysis and Windsurf Cascade handles coding, with all context memory persisting through Windsurf's `.pd` files.

**Technical Questions:**
1. Is there documentation for `.pd` file format?
2. Does Windsurf support Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers?
3. Can external tools programmatically inject context into Cascade sessions?
4. What's the recommended approach for third-party AI tool integration?
5. Is it safe to monitor/modify `.pd` files externally?
6. Are there plans for a plugin/extension system?

**Implementation:** Python-based middleware monitoring `.pd` files, sending context to Gemini CLI for semantic analysis, then injecting enriched context back into Cascade sessions.

**Environment:** Windsurf Pro with Claude Sonnet 4 BYOK, macOS, Python/Node.js development capabilities.
