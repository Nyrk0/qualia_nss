# Collaborative Implementation Plan — Psychoacoustic WebApp for Measuring Delay, Reverb & Comb Filtering

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a collaborative approach for designing and implementing a **web-based audio measurement tool**. The system will analyze **time delay (ms), reverberation, and comb-filtering effects** arising from multi-speaker setups. The web app will be accessible via browser, leveraging **Web Audio API** for signal generation, **WebRTC / MediaDevices API** for microphone input, and **DSP algorithms** for time-frequency analysis.

The setup under study:

* **Set A (Front Stereo Speakers)**

  * Frequency response: \~100 Hz – 20 kHz
  * Placement: \~3.5 m in front of listener
  * Separation: \~2 m

* **Set B (Side/Back Stereo Speakers)**

  * Frequency response: \~50 Hz – 2 kHz
  * Placement: \~1 m at each side of listener
  * Resonant frequency: **Fs = ½ of Set A’s Fs** (harmonic relationship)

Key psychoacoustic consideration: **Set B avoids duplicating frequencies >2 kHz**, to reduce comb-filtering artifacts while maximizing perceptual “natural reverb” and spatiality.

## Goals

1. Provide **accessible measurement** of acoustic interactions using only a laptop/phone/tablet with a built-in mic.
2. Generate **reference test signals** (sweeps, MLS, pink noise, impulses) for playback through the user’s speaker setup.
3. Analyze recorded signals to estimate:

   * **Time delay (ms)** between speaker sets
   * **Reverberation** (RT60 or equivalent metric)
   * **Comb-filtering effects**, including constructive/destructive interference patterns and cancelled frequencies.
4. Ensure results are **interpretable** (e.g., plots, heatmaps, delay estimates) for users without advanced DSP knowledge.
5. Provide an **educational layer**, linking results to psychoacoustics (e.g., why certain comb effects are minimized by design).

## Technical Approach

### 1. Signal Generation

* Implement test signals with **Web Audio API**:

  * Logarithmic sine sweep (20 Hz – 20 kHz)
  * Impulse response (short broadband pulse)
  * Pink/white noise bursts
* Synchronize playback timing with measurement routines.

### 2. Data Capture

* Capture microphone input via **MediaDevices.getUserMedia()**.
* Apply calibration routines (relative, not absolute — uncalibrated mic assumption).
* Optional: noise floor estimation before test run.

### 3. Analysis Pipeline

* **Preprocessing**:

  * Normalize input
  * Apply bandpass filters (align with Set A & Set B response bands)

* **Delay Detection**:

  * Cross-correlation between known test signal and recorded signal
  * Estimate direct vs delayed arrivals in ms

* **Reverberation (RT60)**:

  * Use Schroeder integration method on impulse response
  * Estimate T20/T30 → extrapolate RT60

* **Comb-Filtering Detection**:

  * FFT of recorded response
  * Identify notches/peaks in magnitude response
  * Track periodic notch spacing → infer delay in ms (Δf ≈ 1/Δt)

* **Visualization**:

  * Delay timeline (ms)
  * RT60 value with decay curve
  * Frequency response with comb notches highlighted

### 4. Output & Reporting

* Display results in browser as:

  * **Interactive plots** (time vs amplitude, frequency response, waterfall plots)
  * **Numerical summaries** (delay, RT60, dominant comb notch frequencies)
* Export options: JSON / CSV / PNG graphs

---

## Architecture Overview

* **Frontend (WebApp)**:

  * Framework: React + D3.js/Recharts for visualization
  * UI: Simple wizard flow (Select Test → Play Signal → Capture → Results)

* **Core DSP Module**:

  * Written in JavaScript/TypeScript
  * Encapsulated signal generation, correlation, FFT, IR analysis

* **Persistence Layer (Optional)**:

  * Local export only (privacy-first, no server upload by default)
  * Optional cloud sync for collaboration

---

## Implementation Plan (Collaborative Steps)

1. **Stage 1 — Research & Prototyping**

   * Validate feasibility of delay and RT60 estimation using built-in microphones.
   * Prototype sine sweep generation and recording loop.

2. **Stage 2 — DSP Core Development**

   * Implement cross-correlation for delay detection.
   * Implement impulse response analysis for reverberation.
   * Implement FFT-based comb-filter detection.

3. **Stage 3 — Visualization Layer**

   * Build real-time plots for impulse response and FFT.
   * Add comb-notch highlighting.

4. **Stage 4 — UX & Educational Layer**

   * Add explanations (psychoacoustics: why >2 kHz signals excluded in Set B, human perception of reverb, etc.).
   * Provide intuitive delay/reverb interpretation for non-experts.

5. **Stage 5 — Testing & Calibration**

   * Validate with simulated signals (controlled delay + comb patterns).
   * Compare with known acoustics tools (e.g., Room EQ Wizard, ARTA).

## Tools & References

* **APIs**:

  * Web Audio API
  * MediaDevices API
  * Canvas/D3.js for visualization

* **Standards/Concepts**:

  * ISO 3382 (measurement of room acoustic parameters, e.g., RT60)
  * Psychoacoustics: Bark scale, critical bands, Haas effect

* **Comparable Tools**:

  * Room EQ Wizard (desktop, not browser)
  * ARTA, SMAART (industry standard, but proprietary)

---

## Risks & Considerations

* **Uncalibrated microphone**: results are **relative, not absolute**.
* **Browser mic input latency** may affect precise measurements (cross-check required).
* **Noise environment** may contaminate measurements; need to implement pre-test silence check.
* **User misunderstanding**: must present clear guidance to avoid misinterpretation.

---

## Next Steps

1. Decide on **minimum viable prototype (MVP)**: likely delay + basic FFT comb detection.
2. Define **data structures** for analysis outputs.
3. Assign roles:

   * DSP algorithm development
   * Frontend visualization
   * Documentation & educational UX

---

✅ This plan merges **executive vision, psychoacoustic theory, technical feasibility, and staged implementation** into one collaborative document.

Would you like me to now **draft the MVP Stage 1 prototype spec** (sine sweep generator + mic capture + delay estimation) directly in JavaScript/TypeScript so you can test feasibility quickly in a browser?
