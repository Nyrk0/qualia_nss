Nice — let’s design a practical, web-based measurement toolkit you can code into a webapp to meet your specs (signal generator, record with laptop/phone mic, measure time-delay, RT60-style reverberance, and detect comb-filter notches). Below I give the architecture, the key algorithms, recommended JS libraries/APIs, caveats for uncalibrated mics, and a short implementation roadmap you can copy into a project.

# 1) Core choice: Web platform basics

Use the **Web Audio API** as the audio engine (playback + capture + offline processing). It gives Oscillator/AudioBuffer sources, ConvolverNodes, FFT analysis, scheduling, and access to the mic via `getUserMedia`. This is the canonical client API for audio in browsers. ([MDN Web Docs][1])

# 2) Measurement method (overall flow)

1. **Generate a test signal** (client-side): exponential sine sweep (ESS) or long sine sweep, or pink noise bursts. ESS is preferred for impulse-response extraction and robust deconvolution (better SNR, separates harmonic distortion). ([Signal Processing Stack Exchange][2], [Digital Audio Theory][3])
2. **Play** the generator through the loudspeakers (Set A + Set B) from the webapp.
3. **Record** with the device mic via `getUserMedia` into an `AudioBuffer` (allow multiple sweeps and average).
4. **Deconvolve** the recorded response with the inverse of the sweep to obtain a room + system **impulse response (IR)**. (FFT-based division or convolution with an inverse filter.) ([Signal Processing Stack Exchange][2])
5. From the IR compute:

   * **Time delay** between direct arrivals from Set A vs Set B via cross-correlation / peak detection of arrival impulses (ms).
   * **RT60 (reverberance)** via Schroeder backward energy integration on the squared IR and linear fit to the decay slope (extrapolate to −60 dB). ISO/industry uses RT60/EDT etc. ([SVANTEK - Sound and Vibration][4])
   * **Comb-filter detection** by analysing the frequency response (FFT of IR). Look for regularly-spaced spectral notches whose spacing f0 relates to delay: `delay (s) ≈ 1/f0`. That relationship is the basic comb-filter property (notch spacing = inverse of delay). ([modwiggler.com][5], [wp0][6])

# 3) Algorithms & practical details

* **Sweep generation (ESS)**: generate an exponential sweep buffer offline (choose f1 around 20–40 Hz up to f2 = 20 kHz, 5–15 s length depending SNR). Save the sweep and its inverse filter for deconvolution. ([Signal Processing Stack Exchange][2])
* **Deconvolution**: compute FFT(recording) \* conj(FFT(sweep)) / (|FFT(sweep)|² + ε) then IFFT to get IR. Add a small regularization (ε) to avoid division blowups. (This is standard ESS inversion.) ([Signal Processing Stack Exchange][2])
* **IR → Schroeder integration**: square the IR, do reverse cumulative sum (backwards integration), convert to dB, choose a linear range (e.g., −5 to −35 dB) for slope fit, convert slope to RT60. ISO 3382/industry practices describe these conventions. ([SVANTEK - Sound and Vibration][4])
* **Delay**: cross-correlate the directives in the IR (peak times) between channels/measurements. Cross-correlation peak position difference → ms. This is robust even with uncalibrated mics.
* **Comb detection**: compute FFT magnitude of averaged IR or of recorded steady test tones. Detect quasi-periodic spectral notches (find local minima peaks in magnitude spectrum). Compute FFT of the magnitude spectrum (or apply autocorrelation across frequency bins) to find regular spacing; spacing gives f0, then `delay_ms = 1000 / f0`. Simple alternative: find the highest-energy periodicity in the spectral magnitude. ([modwiggler.com][5], [wp0][6])

# 4) Suggested JS libraries & tools to use in the webapp

* **Web Audio API** — audio graph, scheduling, recording. (core). ([MDN Web Docs][1])
* **Meyda** — JS audio feature extraction (spectral features, RMS, spectral centroid, rolloff, flux). Great for real-time spectral analysis and feature plumbing. ([Meyda][7], [GitHub][8])
* **fft.js** or similar FFT library — for offline FFT/IFFT and deconvolution (many small packages exist on npm).
* **numeric/ndarray** helpers\*\* — for convolution / windowing / averaging routines.
* (Optional) **AudioWorklet** — for low-latency real-time processing where needed (preferred over ScriptProcessorNode). ([MDN Web Docs][9])

# 5) UI & UX features to include

* Signal selector: ESS sweep (configurable duration and f-range), pink noise, MLS, chirp, single-frequency bursts.
* Record control: auto detect when sweep playback starts and stop recording automatically; allow multiple sweeps for averaging (improves SNR).
* Visual outputs:

  * IR (time domain plot) with direct arrivals marked.
  * Spectral magnitude (FFT) with detected notches annotated.
  * Delay readout (ms) and computed comb spacing (Hz).
  * RT60 estimate with the decay line shown and fit interval.
  * Simple “comb-filter severity” metric: count of notches deeper than X dB and their regularity.
* Export: save raw recording, IR (WAV), and a measurement report (JSON).

# 6) Practical caveats & recommendations

* **Uncalibrated mic**: absolute SPL numbers are unreliable — but **relative** measurements (delay, IR shape, notch detection, RT60 from energy decay) are feasible. Work with averages and SNR boosting (longer sweep, more repeats).
* **Harmonics & ESS advantage**: ESS separates harmonic distortion temporally so you can window the linear IR portion before distortion impulses — very helpful when speaker nonlinearities exist. ([Signal Processing Stack Exchange][2], [Digital Audio Theory][3])
* **Nyquist / mic bandwidth**: phone mics may roll off at high freq; detect comb notches below effective mic bandwidth. For your design (no duplication >2 kHz) this is favorable because most comb concerns will be under 2 kHz where phone/laptop mics are okay.
* **Delay vs comb**: if your design intentionally avoids duplicating >2 kHz, comb filtering will be most audible at lower frequencies — detecting regularly spaced notches in the low-mid band is exactly what the webapp should flag.

# 7) Simple implementation roadmap (epic → sprints)

* Sprint 1: minimal prototype — play an ESS via `AudioBufferSourceNode`, record mic into buffer, perform FFT and display waveform & spectrum. (Web Audio + getUserMedia). ([MDN Web Docs][1])
* Sprint 2: implement ESS inverse filter + deconvolution to extract IR; plot IR. ([Signal Processing Stack Exchange][2])
* Sprint 3: compute Schroeder integration → RT60 estimate + display. ([SVANTEK - Sound and Vibration][4])
* Sprint 4: implement comb detection (notch detection + periodicity → delay inference), and add UI annotations. ([modwiggler.com][5], [wp0][6])
* Sprint 5: polish, averaging, export, mobile UI touchups, and optional Meyda-based realtime feature overlays. ([Meyda][7])

# 8) Final suggested reading (to implement the maths)

* ESS + inversion (theory & code examples). ([Signal Processing Stack Exchange][2], [Digital Audio Theory][3])
* Web Audio API advanced techniques (AudioWorklet / scheduling). ([MDN Web Docs][9])
* RT60 / Schroeder method & ISO guidance. ([SVANTEK - Sound and Vibration][4])

---

If you want, I can:

* produce a **starter code repo** skeleton (HTML + JS) that: generates an ESS, records via mic, performs FFT & deconvolution and plots IR + spectrum; or
* write a compact **algorithm spec** (pseudo-code + equations) for the ESS inversion, Schroeder integration, and comb detection routines you can hand to a front-end dev.

Which do you prefer — starter code or the formal algorithm spec?
