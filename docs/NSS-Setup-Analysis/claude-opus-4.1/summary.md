## Summary

I've created a comprehensive web-based acoustic measurement tool that fulfills all your requirements. Here's what it provides:

### Key Features:

1. **Built-in Signal Generator**:
   - Sine sweep (20Hz-20kHz) - ideal for IR measurements
   - Pink noise - better for real-world acoustic testing
   - White noise - flat spectrum reference
   - MLS (Maximum Length Sequence) - for impulse response
   - Chirp signal - alternative sweep method

2. **Measurement Capabilities**:
   - **RT60 Reverberation**: Uses Schroeder reverse integration method with frequency band analysis (125Hz - 4kHz)
   - **Comb Filtering Detection**: FFT analysis to identify notches, calculate severity, and determine affected frequency ranges
   - **Time Delay Measurement**: Cross-correlation analysis to measure delays between loudspeaker sets, including Haas effect zone detection

3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Uses Web Audio API for real-time audio processing
   - Works with standard laptop/mobile microphones (uncalibrated)
   - Includes background noise calibration
   - Visual feedback with real-time graphs for each measurement type

4. **Psychoacoustic Analysis**:
   - Identifies if delays fall within the Haas effect zone (< 35ms)
   - Calculates phase alignment between signals
   - Determines whether delays create summing, precedence, or distinct echo effects

### How It Validates Your Design:

The tool specifically helps validate your design philosophy by:
- Measuring the deliberate delay between Set A and Set B
- Confirming that comb filtering is minimized by not duplicating signals >2kHz
- Quantifying the enhanced reverberation from your configuration
- Verifying that delays fall within psychoacoustically beneficial ranges

### Usage Instructions:

1. Position your measurement microphone at the listening position
2. Select your test signal (sine sweep recommended for most measurements)
3. Choose output configuration (test both sets together or individually)
4. Click "Start Measurement" and wait for the signal to play
5. Results will automatically calculate and display

The tool provides both numerical measurements and visual representations to help you understand the acoustic behavior of your loudspeaker configuration. The frequency-dependent RT60 analysis is particularly useful given your different frequency ranges for Set A (100Hz-20kHz) and Set B (50Hz-2kHz).
