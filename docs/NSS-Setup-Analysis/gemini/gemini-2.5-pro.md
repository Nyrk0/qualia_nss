Of course. The core technology you can code into a web app to perform these measurements is the **Web Audio API**.

The Web Audio API is a high-level JavaScript API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications. It provides all the necessary modules for signal generation (your test tones) and analysis (capturing microphone input and processing it). You won't need an external library for the core audio functions, but you might use a charting library for visualization.

Hereâ€™s how you can use the Web Audio API to measure each requirement.

### ## 1. Reverberation (RT60)

Reverberation time (RT60) is the time it takes for a sound to decay by 60 dB. You can measure this using the **impulse response** method.

**How it works in a web app:**
1.  **Signal Generation**: Use an `AudioBufferSourceNode` to generate an ideal impulse (a single sample at full amplitude) or a logarithmic sine sweep. A sine sweep is generally better as it introduces more energy into the room for a better signal-to-noise ratio.
2.  **Measurement**: Use a `MediaStreamAudioSourceNode` to capture the room's response through the device's microphone.
3.  **Analysis**:
    * If you used a sine sweep, you perform a mathematical process called **deconvolution** on the recording to calculate the room's Impulse Response (IR).
    * From the IR, you apply **Schroeder's backward integration method** to calculate the energy decay curve.
    * Analyze this curve to find the time it takes for the energy to drop by 60 dB. Because of background noise, it's standard to measure the decay from -5 dB to -25 dB (a 20 dB drop, called T20) or from -5 dB to -35 dB (a 30 dB drop, called T30) and then extrapolate to find RT60. For example, $RT60 = 3 \times T20$.

### ## 2. Comb-filtering

Comb-filtering appears as a series of deep, regularly spaced notches and peaks in the frequency response. The easiest way to detect this is by measuring the system's frequency response.

**How it works in a web app:**
1.  **Signal Generation**: The best signal is a **logarithmic sine sweep** that covers the full frequency range (e.g., 20 Hz to 20 kHz). Alternatively, you can play **pink noise**, which has equal energy per octave.
2.  **Measurement**: Capture the playback through the microphone.
3.  **Analysis**:
    * **Method A (Sine Sweep)**: As with the RT60 measurement, you deconvolve the recorded sweep to get the Impulse Response. Then, you apply a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the IR to get the high-resolution frequency response.
    * **Method B (Pink Noise)**: While playing pink noise, use the `AnalyserNode`. This node can perform an FFT in real-time. By averaging the results over a few seconds, you get a stable frequency response plot.
4.  **Visualization**: Plot the resulting frequency data on a logarithmic scale. The characteristic "comb" pattern of peaks and nulls will be immediately visible if comb-filtering is present.

### ## 3. Time Delay

To measure the delay between the front (Set A) and side (Set B) speakers, you can measure the arrival time of a signal from each set to the microphone.

**How it works in a web app:**
1.  **Signal Generation**: Use an `AudioBufferSourceNode` to generate a very short, sharp sound, like a **click** or a single-cycle high-frequency tone. This is an acoustic impulse.
2.  **Measurement**:
    * First, play the impulse **only through Set A** and record the response.
    * Then, play the same impulse **only through Set B** and record the response.
3.  **Analysis**:
    * In the two recorded audio buffers, find the exact time of the first major peak in the waveform. This is the signal's arrival time.
    * The time delay is the difference between the arrival time of the signal from Set A and the arrival time of the signal from Set B.
    * For example, if the Set A peak is at 10.3 ms and the Set B peak is at 3.0 ms, the delay from Set A relative to Set B is $10.3 - 3.0 = 7.3$ ms.

This approach is highly reliable for measuring the direct path delay between different sound sources.
