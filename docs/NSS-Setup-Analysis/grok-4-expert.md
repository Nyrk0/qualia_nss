To fulfill the requirements of measuring reverberation (e.g., RT60), comb-filtering (constructive/destructive interference and cancelled frequencies), and time delay (in milliseconds) between the loudspeaker sets in a web app, the primary tool to code with is the Web Audio API. This is a native JavaScript API built into modern browsers, providing direct access to audio generation, microphone input, playback, recording, and real-time processing. It meets all criteria: built-in signal generation (sine sweeps, pink noise, etc.), compatibility with uncalibrated laptop/mobile microphones via `getUserMedia()`, and the ability to perform the necessary acoustic measurements through custom processing.

### Why Web Audio API?
- **Native and Embeddable**: It's designed for web apps, requiring no external dependencies beyond standard JavaScript. You can integrate it into a React, Vue, or vanilla JS app for a user-friendly interface (e.g., buttons to start measurements, visualize results).
- **Signal Generation**: Supports creating and playing test signals like exponential sine sweeps (for impulse response measurement) or pink noise (for reverberation analysis) using nodes like `OscillatorNode` (for sweeps by linearly or exponentially ramping frequency) and `AudioBufferSourceNode` (for custom buffers like pink noise generated via algorithms).
- **Microphone Access and Recording**: Use `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` to access the device's microphone, then route it through an `AudioContext` for recording. Recordings can be captured in real-time using `MediaRecorder` or processed via `ScriptProcessorNode`/`AudioWorkletNode` for analysis.
- **Measurement Capabilities**: All required metrics can be derived by generating a test signal, playing it through the loudspeakers, recording the response, and processing the data in JS. No external hardware calibration is needed, as uncalibrated mics are acceptable per your requirements.
- **Enhancements with Libraries**: For easier implementation, pair it with:
  - **Tone.js**: A high-level wrapper around Web Audio API for simplified signal generation (e.g., `Tone.Oscillator` for sweeps with `frequency.rampTo()`, `Tone.Noise` for pink noise), microphone input (`Tone.UserMedia`), and basic analysis (e.g., `Tone.FFT` for frequency response, `Tone.Meter` for levels). It's ideal for interactive web apps and handles polyphony/timing.
  - **FFT Libraries**: For deconvolution and spectral analysis, use `fft-js` (a pure JS FFT/IFFT implementation) or `dsp.js` (includes FFT and other DSP tools). These enable computing impulse responses (IRs) from recordings.

The goal of validating your design (avoiding >2 kHz duplication for reduced comb-filtering while enhancing reverberation) aligns perfectly, as these tools can detect artifacts via IR-derived metrics.

### Implementation Overview
Build the web app as follows (high-level steps; full code would involve an `AudioContext` setup, user permissions for mic access, and UI for results display):

1. **Setup Audio Context and Permissions**:
   - Create an `AudioContext` (or use `Tone.context` if using Tone.js).
   - Request mic access: `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })` to get a `MediaStream`, then create a `MediaStreamAudioSourceNode`.
   - Handle user interaction (e.g., a "Start Measurement" button) to resume the context, as browsers block audio until user gesture.

2. **Built-in Signal Generator**:
   - **Sine Sweep (Exponential for IR Measurement)**: Preferred for accurate IRs (better SNR than impulses like claps). Use `OscillatorNode` with frequency ramping from ~20 Hz to 20 kHz over 5-10 seconds. Example with Tone.js:
     ```
     const sweep = new Tone.Oscillator({
       type: 'sine',
       frequency: 20 // start freq
     }).toDestination();
     sweep.start();
     sweep.frequency.exponentialRampTo(20000, 10); // sweep over 10 seconds
     ```
     - Stop after duration and include silence for tail capture.
   - **Pink Noise**: Generate a buffer with 1/f noise spectrum (e.g., via random values filtered in frequency domain using FFT), then play via `AudioBufferSourceNode`. Tone.js has `Tone.Noise({ type: 'pink' })`.

3. **Recording the Response**:
   - Play the signal through Set A and/or Set B.
   - Simultaneously record via mic using `MediaRecorder` to capture a blob, or stream samples through `AudioWorkletNode` for real-time processing.
   - Convert recording to Float32Array for analysis (e.g., via `Blob.arrayBuffer()` and `AudioContext.decodeAudioData()`).

4. **Processing for Measurements**:
   - **Compute Impulse Response (IR)**: Use the Farina method for sine sweepsâ€”deconvolve by convolving the recorded signal with the time-reversed sweep (or in frequency domain: FFT(recorded) / FFT(sweep), then IFFT). This yields the room's IR, capturing delay, reverb, and filtering.
     - With `fft-js`: Import the library, compute FFTs, perform complex division, IFFT to get IR array.
     - Example pseudocode:
       ```
       const fft = require('fft-js').fft;
       const ifft = require('fft-js').ifft;
       const recordedFFT = fft(recordedSamples);
       const sweepFFT = fft(sweepSamples); // precompute sweep
       const irFFT = recordedFFT.map((val, i) => val / sweepFFT[i]); // complex divide
       const ir = ifft(irFFT); // real part is IR
       ```
   - **Time Delay (ms)**: Find the time of the maximum peak in the IR (first direct path arrival). Delay = (peakIndex / sampleRate) * 1000. Compare IRs from Set A vs. Set B for inter-set delay.
   - **Reverberation (RT60)**: From IR, compute Schroeder integral (backward integration of squared IR). For each octave band (filter IR with bandpass, e.g., via Tone.js `Tone.Filter`), fit a line from -5 dB to -35 dB drop and extrapolate to -60 dB. RT60 = time for 60 dB decay. Use pink noise recordings for steady-state reverb if needed.
   - **Comb-Filtering**: Compute frequency response as FFT of IR. Look for periodic notches (destructive interference) or peaks (constructive), e.g., notches at f = 1/(2*delay), multiples. Threshold for detection (e.g., >3 dB dips every ~172 Hz for 2 ms delay). Validate your design by checking reduced notches >2 kHz.

5. **Validation and Output**:
   - Display results: Plots (IR waveform, freq response via canvas/WebGL), tables for metrics (e.g., RT60 per band, delay ms, comb notch frequencies).
   - Detect artifacts: Compare measured delay (~10-20 ms based on positions), enhanced reverb (higher RT60 in lows from Set B), reduced comb (fewer notches >2 kHz).
   - Handle room reflections: Average multiple runs; warn on clipping/noise.

### Example Web App Structure (Using Tone.js for Simplicity)
- HTML: Buttons for "Generate Sweep", "Record", "Analyze".
- JS:
  ```
  import * as Tone from 'tone';
  import fft from 'fft-js';

  async function startMeasurement() {
    await Tone.start(); // user gesture
    const mic = new Tone.UserMedia().open();
    // Generate and play sweep...
    // Record...
    // Deconvolve with fft...
    // Compute metrics...
  }
  ```
- Full prototypes can leverage open-source examples like those in Reverb.js (for IR handling) or custom DSP in WASM for performance (e.g., as in OPRA tool).

### Additional Resources
- For ready analysis of computed IRs, integrate or link to OPRA (https://www.opra.isave.hs-duesseldorf.de), a free web tool that uploads IRs and computes RT60, EDT, clarity, etc., based on ISO 3382-1.
- Test in quiet rooms; account for browser limits (e.g., iOS requires HTTPS for mic).
- If needed, extend with psychoacoustics (e.g., bark-scale filtering for perceived spaciousness).

This approach is reliable, low-cost, and directly codable into a web app for your setup.
