# Feature Request: Automated Integration Between Windsurf Cascade and Gemini CLI

## Problem Statement

I'm seeking to enhance Windsurf Cascade's context management capabilities by integrating it with Gemini CLI's strengths: advanced semantic analysis, large context windows, and agent-like UI/UX workflows.

## Proposed Integration Goals

### Primary Objective
Create an automated bridge between Windsurf Cascade and Gemini CLI that leverages:
- **Gemini CLI**: Context analysis, semantic understanding, and project-wide memory management
- **Windsurf Cascade**: Primary coding environment with Claude Sonnet 4 (via BYOK)
- **Windsurf's .pd files**: As the central context memory storage system

### Specific Use Case
1. Gemini CLI pre-processes and maintains semantic understanding of large codebases
2. Context flows automatically between Gemini's analysis and Cascade's coding sessions
3. All context memory persists through Windsurf's native `.pd` file system
4. Enhanced project continuity and architectural awareness across coding sessions

## Technical Implementation Questions

### 1. Integration Approach Options
- **Natural Language Chat Integration**: Direct communication between Cascade chat and Gemini CLI
- **Custom MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Python-based local implementation acting as middleware
- **File System Bridge**: Monitor/sync `.pd` files with Gemini context

### 2. Context Management Architecture
```
Windsurf Cascade ↔ Context Bridge ↔ Gemini CLI
     (.pd files) ↔ (MCP/Python) ↔ (Semantic Analysis)
```

### 3. Specific Technical Requirements
- **Automated workflow**: No manual context copying between tools
- **Real-time sync**: Context updates during active Cascade sessions  
- **Persistent memory**: All context driven by Windsurf's `.pd` file system
- **Semantic preprocessing**: Gemini analyzes codebase structure before Cascade tasks

## Questions for Windsurf Team

### Documentation & API Access
1. **`.pd` File Format**: Is there documentation for Windsurf's context file structure?
2. **MCP Support**: Does Windsurf support or plan to support Model Context Protocol servers?
3. **Context API**: Are there APIs to programmatically inject context into Cascade sessions?

### Integration Possibilities  
4. **Third-party Integration**: What's the recommended approach for integrating external AI tools with Cascade?
5. **File System Monitoring**: Can external tools safely monitor/modify `.pd` files without breaking Windsurf?
6. **Plugin System**: Are there plans for a plugin/extension system that could facilitate this integration?

### Technical Feasibility
7. **Context Injection**: How can external tools provide enriched context to ongoing Cascade conversations?
8. **Session Management**: Is it possible to programmatically start Cascade sessions with pre-loaded context?
9. **Memory Persistence**: How does Windsurf handle context memory across different project sessions?

## Expected Outcome

A seamless workflow where:
- Gemini CLI maintains intelligent project memory and semantic analysis
- Windsurf Cascade handles actual code implementation with enhanced contextual awareness
- Developers benefit from both tools' strengths without manual context management
- All context persists naturally through Windsurf's existing `.pd` file system

## Additional Context

- Currently using Claude Sonnet 4 via BYOK in Windsurf Pro
- Familiar with Python development for custom integrations
- Open to contributing to community solutions if this benefits other developers
